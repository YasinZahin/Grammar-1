Pronoun: is a word, use instead of a noun which prevents the repeatation of nouns.
Example: saeeda(noun) is drinking cola. -> She(pronoun) is drinking water.

A pronoun is a word that replaces a noun in a sentence. Pronouns are used to avoid repeating the same nouns over and over again. For example, "Jeremy ran so fast, you'd think his life was on the line." The pronoun "his" saved us from repeating the name Jeremy again.

Common pronouns include I, me, mine, she, he, it, we, and us. In truth, there are many different types of pronouns, each serving a different purpose.

Personal Pronouns
Personal pronouns are used as a substitute for a person's name. There are two kinds: subjective and objective pronouns. That is, they either act as the subject of the sentence or the object of the sentence.

As the subject of a sentence, they are:

I

you

he

she

it

we

they

For example:

They went to the store.

I don't want to leave.

He runs a great shop in town.

You can't leave, either.

As the object of the sentence, they are:

me

you

her

him

it

us

them

For example:

Please don't sit beside me.

Go talk to her.

Mary put the gift under it.

Don't look at them.

Possessive Pronouns
Possessive pronouns show ownership or possession of a noun. They are:

my

our

your

his

her

its (note there is no apostrophe)

their

For example:

Is that my book?

No, that's his book.

That's its shelf.

I'd like to see their bookshelves.

However, there are also independent possessive pronouns. These pronouns refer to a previously named or understood noun. They stand alone and aren't followed by any other noun. They are:

mine

ours

yours

his

hers

its

theirs

For example:

That's mine.

Wrong. It's ours.

So, I suppose those clothes are yours?

No, it's theirs.

Indefinite Pronouns
Indefinite pronouns don't point to particular nouns. We use them when an object doesn't need to be specifically identified. As such, it can remain indefinite. They include:

few

everyone

all

some

anything

nobody

For example:

Most wealth is held by a select few.

Everyone is here already.

I don't have any paper napkins. Can you bring some?

He's nobody.

Relative Pronouns
Relative pronouns are used to connect a clause or phrase to a noun or pronoun. We often see them when we need to add more information. They are:

who

whom

which

whoever

whomever

whichever

that

For example:

The driver who ran the stop sign was careless.

I don't know which pair of shoes you want.

Take whichever ones you want.

No, not that one.

Intensive Pronouns
Intensive pronouns emphasize, or intensify, nouns and pronouns. Typically, we find them right after the noun they're intensifying. These pronouns typically end in -self or -selves. They are:

myself

himself

herself

themselves

itself

yourself

yourselves

ourselves

For example:

I myself like to travel.

He himself is his worst critic.

She approved the marriage herself.

We went to hear W.B. Yeats himself speak.

Demonstrative Pronouns
Demonstrative pronouns take the place of a noun that's already been mentioned. They can be singular or plural. There are five of them. They include:

these

those

this

that

such

For example:

These are ugly.

Those are lovely.

Don't drink this.

Such was his understanding.

Interrogative Pronouns
Interrogative pronouns do just what they say. They work in sentences that are posing a question. They are:

who

whom

which

what

whoever

whomever

whichever

whatever

For example:

Who is going to arrive first?

What are you bringing to the party?

Which of these do you like better?

Whatever do you mean?

Reflexive Pronouns
Reflexive pronouns are similar to intensive pronouns. The difference between the two is that intensive pronouns aren't essential to a sentence's meaning. Meanwhile, reflexive pronouns are. Also, they're used when the subject and the object of a sentence refer to the same person or thing. These pronouns end in -self or -selves. They are:

myself

yourself

himself

herself

itself

ourselves

yourselves

themselves

For example:

I told myself not to spend all my money on new shoes.

You're going to have to drive yourself to the restaurant today.

We gave ourselves plenty of extra time.

They bought themselves a new car.

What is a pronoun?
A pronoun is a word that is used instead of a noun or noun phrase. Pronouns refer to either a noun that has already been mentioned or to a noun that does not need to be named specifically.

The most common pronouns are the personal pronouns, which refer to the person or people speaking or writing (first person), the person or people being spoken to (second person), or other people or things (third person). Like nouns, personal pronouns can function as either the subject of a verb or the object of a verb or preposition: "She likes him, but he loves her." Most of the personal pronouns have different subject and object forms:

There are a number of other types of pronouns. The interrogative pronouns—particularly what, which, who, whom, and whose—introduce questions for which a noun is the answer, as in "Which do you prefer?"

Possessive pronouns refer to things or people that belong to someone. The main possessive pronouns are mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, and theirs.

The four demonstrative pronouns—this, that, these, and those—distinguish the person or thing being referred to from other people or things; they are identical to the demonstrative adjectives.

Relative pronouns introduce a subordinate clause, a part of a sentence that includes a subject and verb but does not form a sentence by itself. The main relative pronouns are that, which, who, whom, what, and whose.

Reflexive pronouns refer back to the subject of a sentence or clause and are formed by adding -self or -selves to a personal pronoun or possessive adjective, as in myself, herself, ourselves, and itself.

Indefinite pronouns, such as everybody, either, none, and something, do not refer to a specific person or thing, and typically refer to an unidentified or unfamiliar person or thing.

The words it and there can also be used like pronouns when the rules of grammar require a subject but no noun is actually being referred to. Both are usually used at the beginning of a sentence or clause, as in "It was almost noon" and "There is some cake left." These are sometimes referred to as expletives.
